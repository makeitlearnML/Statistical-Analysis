### Marketing A/B Testing

What is A/B testing?
A/B testing is a basic randomized control experiment. It is a way to compare the two versions of a variable to find out which performs better in a controlled environment.

It is a hypothetical testing methodology for making decisions that estimate population parameters based on sample statistics. The population refers to all the customers buying your product, while the sample refers to the number of customers that participated in the test.

Here in our project, a Marketing company want to run successful campaigns, but the market is complex and several options can work. The companies are interested in answering two questions:

Would the campaign be successful?
If the campaign was successful, how much of that success could be attributed to the ads?
With the second question in mind, we normally do an A/B test. The majority of the people will be exposed to ads (the experimental group). And a small portion of people (the control group) would instead see a Public Service Announcement (PSA) (or nothing) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be.

The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups, find if the ads were successful, how much the company can make from the ads, and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.
